## This is the up-to-date version of `app_dirs`

The original [app_dirs](https://lib.rs/crates/app_dirs) crate is unmaintained and has seriously outdated dependencies. This is an fork that keeps the crate working and up-to-date.

This is a *community-maintained project*, so if you find a bug or the crate is missing support for your platform, please help out.

There are no major changes planned. If you're looking for a crate with more features, check out the [directories](https://lib.rs/crates/directories) crate.
